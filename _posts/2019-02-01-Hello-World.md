title: Entering the World of Medical Data Science
---

Hello, My name is Joseph Santos. This is my first blog post. Here I will describe what its like to be a Cuban American A.I. researcher and document my journey to becoming a data scientist in the medical field. My goals are to:
(1): Use deep learning to aid in the prognosis and diagnosis of neurologial disorders and mental illnesses. 
(2): Reduce the time doctors have to spend using EMR software. 
(3): Use deep learning for the purpose of drug discovery.

I start my journey with an application I sent to OpenAI for the Winter Scholars 2019 program. If accepted into the program, I believe I will work on either diagnosis of Alzheimers or improving EMR software. Its important that I remember that I will only have around 13 weeks to complete these tasks. Ideally I would work on diagnosis however, that may prove to be a bit too complicated for such a short period of time. We will see.
